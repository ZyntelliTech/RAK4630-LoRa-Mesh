# RAK4630-LoRa-Mesh

### Requirements

-Build a Proof-of-Concept LoRa system with RAK4630 WisBlock node board and Draguino DLOS8N Outdoor LoRaWan gateway.

- The gateway is connected to the Arduino Cloud.
- Build a mesh network with the RAK4630 boards and the gateway.
- The communication range is up to 10Km
- The RAK4630 will use a small battery and solar panel, so keep ultra-low power consumption.
- The RAK4630 has analog input(0-5V), two digital inputs, and serial input and transfers them to the Arduino Cloud.
- The RAK4630 will has 1-2 digital output and the Arduino Cloud can send commands to the RAK4630 to turn on/off the digital outputs.
